# Twitter Python library install instructions

We'll use the twitter library.  Unfortunately, the library is not
installed in the Anaconda python distribution by default.  If you 
try to import it, this is what you will see:

```
$ python
Python 2.7.2 (default, Oct 11 2012, 20:14:37) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import twitter
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named twitter
>>> 
```

The good news: the installation process is surprisingly simple when
you use the Anaconda python distribution.

**OSX:** 
Open a terminal window 

**Windows**
Open the "Anaconda Command Prompt"

Now type the following:
```
$ pip install twitter
```

You should *hopefully* see the following output:
```
Downloading/unpacking twitter

Congrats! You've installed the twitter python library! Now when you try 
importing the twitter library in python you should't see an error.
